# DeepLab-v3 Pre-Trained Model for PSOC™ Edge

This code example demonstrates how to deploy the DeepLabV3 MobilenetV3 Semantic Segmentation model on the PSoC™ Edge MCU. It uses a USB HBVCAM OV7675 0.3MP Mini Camera to capture live video, where the model detects and segments a person in the video feed using ModusToolbox™. The detected person is segmented using a mask.

## Pre-requisites

* Setup "PSOC&trade; Edge ML AI Hub Deploy Vision" Application, refer to the README at https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-aihub-deploy-vision for detailed setup and usage instructions

### Deployment steps

1. Once the "PSOC&trade; Edge ML AI Hub Deploy Vision" application is imported successfully, follow the below steps to Deploy DeepLabV3 MobilenetV3 Semantic Segmentation Vision model

2. Go to [DeepLabV3 MobilenetV3 Semantic Segmentation FW Artifacts](https://github.com/Infineon/deepcraft-model-zoo-for-psoc/tree/main/DeepLabv3/fw) and copy all the .h and .a files to <application_workspace>/ml_pipeline_eur_libs directory

3. Open proj_cm55/Makefile and update the following variables for DeepLabV3 MobilenetV3 Semantic Segmentation model
- NN_TYPE=int8x8
- NN_MODEL_NAME=DEEPLAB_V3_MOBILENETV3_SEGMENTATION
- LDLIBS+=../ml_pipeline_eur_libs/DEEPLAB_V3_MOBILENETV3_SEGMENTATION_pipeline.a
- DEFINES+=ML_IMAGIMOB_CM55 MODEL_NAME=$(NN_MODEL_NAME) CY_ML_MODEL_MEM=.constdata

4. Build the full project

5. Program the application to PSOC Edge HW

6. Once the application hex is successfully flashed to PSOC Edge HW, DeepLabV3 MobilenetV3 Semantic Segmentation use-case will start running by default.

### Pre-Built Binaries

There is a pre-built FW binary available for this use-case under "psoc_edge_fw_binary" directory that can be directly flashed onto PSOC Edge MCU using ModusToolbox™ Programmer tool.

For detailed flashing instructions, refer to [**ModusToolbox™ Programmer Documentation (Section 5.14)**](https://www.infineon.com/row/public/documents/30/44/infineon-modustoolbox-gui-user-guide-usermanual-en.pdf). Same steps applicable for flashing to external QSPI/OSPI.
